## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to understand how to implement a Citi Bike service in Des Moines. By analyzing our customer base, broken down by gender, user type, and usage, we can uncover how the service would operate and look in another city.

We can uncover what demographics to market to, and when would be the best time for maintenance of bikes to ensure the upmost safety of customers.

This visualization is dedicated to the breakdown of rides by customer type. As we can see in the top graphic, our user base is broken up by those who are just customers and those who are subscribed to the service. From this, we can see that people are willing and able to subscribe to the monthly service for unlimited access.

Our bottom graphic breaks down what gender most uses this service and what days of the week are most popular for that population. We can also understand the viability of such a service in a different city.

This visualization shows us what hours are typically most popular on a standard day. This data can show us when would be the most opportune time. We can see the hours between 1 AM and 4 AM would be the best time to conduct maintenance of bikes.

This visualization is a heatmap that shows the most popular hours of the day when trips are completed by weekday. This can show us which days of the week would be best for higher levels of maintenance. Monday-Friday from 1 AM to 4 AM are the best days and times for this.

This visualization is a further breakdown of the previous heatmap. This shows how genders are utilizing the service at different times of the day throughout the week. We can use this to see how our customer base in Des Moines might look and behave.

This visualization showcases how long trips typically last. This is also broken down by gender as well. With this we can tell that many people are not using the service for long trips. We can tell that people will mostly use the service for trips that last 15 minutes or less. New York's compact nature allows this to be successful, so high levels of success with longer commutes in Des Moines could be costly.

## Summary

We understand how to operate the business in Des Moines based on our analysis. Maintenance should be completed Monday-Fridays from 1 AM and 4 AM. We should market more to our Male audience when it comes to offering monthly subscriptions. These Bikes should also be located in a compact area to keep trip durations short.

We can further continue our breakdown of our user base by age. We can utilize the Birth Year of our subscribers in New York to understand what age demographic to market to as well.

We can also gain an understanding of how many bikes would be needed for this service. We can take each bike and see how many rides are taken on each one during the week via a heatmap. If we see that some bikes are not heavily used, we could conclude that there may be more than enough bikes for the city.
